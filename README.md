# novelWriter

**Version Dev0.2**

*Under initial development*

A simple editor for writing books by providing a simple editor with basic formatting.
Centred around writing the the book scene by scene.

**Based on:** Python3, Gtk 3 and WebKit 3.

Core (intended) features for initial version:

* Files are organised as scenes that can be assigned to chapters.
* Files are organised into draft numbers, and each file can be given version numbers if desired to keep previous version
  of scenes within each draft number.
* A simple database of characters that can be linked to scenes.
* Keeps track of word count and time spent editing individual files.

Further featured planned:

* Export features to html and possibly other formats.
* Footnotes

This program is intended as a minimal editor with as little clutter as possible. It is designed to suit my own needs.
I use note taking software to outline plots and character profiles, and do research. I use zim, but find the program
less suited for the actual writing, and other editors like FocusWriter to be too lacking in features alltogether.
